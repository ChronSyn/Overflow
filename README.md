# Overflow (Chrome)
Overflow is an extension built to counter anti-adblock practices being employed by numerous websites. These websites typically disable scrolling of the main content while presenting an overlay telling you to disable adblock or pay them.

This extension adds a toolbar icon to Chrome where you can blacklist sites (you can also remove a blacklisted site using the same icon). This extension will attempt to restore scrolling and remove the overlay.

### Websites employing anti-adblock tech;
We have adblock installed for security and performance reasons, and because you have chosen to create inconveninent adverts such as full page popups and overlays.

I am not against marketing or advertising and have numerous websites whitelisted where their adverts do not interfere with the main content or compromise my security by using advert networks with a history of distributing malware.
However, I am actively against websites that feel that good marketing involves creating prominent distraction from the main content.
